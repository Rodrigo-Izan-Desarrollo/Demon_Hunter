# Demon-Hunter

## Objectives 

Your objective is to advance to defeat the slime king while navigating through a myriad of challenges. As a player, you start with two lives and have the opportunity to respawn twice throughout the game.

Be careful, as various types of obstacles await, and appearances can be deceiving. Don't underestimate even the simplest hurdles, as they may hold unexpected surprises. Stay focused, strategize wisely, and aim to reach that third checkpoint with at least one life intact. Good luck!
